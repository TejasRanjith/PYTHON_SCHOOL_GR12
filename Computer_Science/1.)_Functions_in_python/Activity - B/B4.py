# Lesson 1
#* Design a python program that accepts two numbers from the user and calls function
#* max(a,b) that returns the largest number. Function call is made only if numbers are
#* not equal. (Do not use built-in function)

#? According to me:
# def max(n1,n2):
#     if n1 > n2:
#         print(n1,"is greater than",n2)
#         return n1
#     elif n1 < n2:
#         print(n2,"is greater than",n1)
#         return n2
#     else:
#         print("Both the numbers",n1,"and",n2,", are equal.")
#         return 0

# #! MAIN:

# num1 = int(input("Number 1.) --> "))
# num2 = int(input("Number 2.) --> "))
# max(num1,num2)


#? According to mam:
def max():
    pass
